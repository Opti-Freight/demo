# Opti-Freight

Federated Freight Network.

## Introduction:

Opti-Freight is an Owner-Operator Federated Network designed to leverage blockchain technology to revolutionize freight logistics. Built on Solana, it tokenizes haul capacity through a system of SPL 404 contracts, creating a secure, transparent, and efficient way for owner-operators to manage and monetize their haul capabilities.

## Objectives:

To develop a decentralized platform that enhances the transparency, efficiency, and profitability of haulage services for owner-operators. By tokenizing haul capacity and jobs, Opti-Freight aims to give drivers control, reduce overhead, and optimize logistics through smart contracts and AI-driven route optimization.
